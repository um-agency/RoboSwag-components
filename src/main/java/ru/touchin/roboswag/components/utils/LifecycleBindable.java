/**

 * Interface that should be implemented by lifecycle-based elements ({@link android.app.Activity}, {@link android.support.v4.app.Fragment} etc.)
 * to not manually manage subscriptions.
 * Use {@link #bind(Observable, Action1)} method to subscribe to observable onStart and unsubscribe onStop automatically.
 * Use {@link #untilStop(Observable)} method to subscribe to observable where you want and unsubscribe onStop.
 * Use {@link #untilDestroy(Observable)} method to subscribe to observable where you want and unsubscribe onDestroy.
